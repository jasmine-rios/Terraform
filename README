# Terraform

## Introduction

Terraform is a software that you can use with many cloud service providers (CSP) such as Azure, AWS, or GCP to create resources such as ec2 instances. 
Using terraform allows you to make sure all your resources are properly deployed in minutes and can be used in automation. 
It acts as IaC (Infrastructure as code) to make deploying all cloud resources in your account so you don't have to worry about messing it up in the console.
