# Preqs to Install Terraform on Mac

## Install Brew

You have to install Brew which is a package manager that will allow you to get whatever you want on your Mac Terminal. Whatever package you need, it has. 

### Steps to Install Brew

1. While logged into your Mac computer and signed in, navigate to the magnifing glass in the top right. 

2. A little bar should appear that says Spotlight Search, type in Terminal

3. (Optional) With Terminal open on your Mac, right-click the mouse on the terminal app in the dock. The dock is at the bottom of the Mac Screen. 
With the options box open click Options> Keep in Dock. This allows you to find terminal easier then finding it each time.

4. While in the home directory of the terminal use these commands to install brew (the command cd ~ will help you to go to home directory):

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

5. Allow it to install then run this to make sure you have Brew:

brew --version

Congrats! Brew is installed.

## Terraform account

1. You must have a terraform account at https://app.terraform.io/app/getting-started with your email verified. This will help on part 2.

You should now be set to go to next step.
