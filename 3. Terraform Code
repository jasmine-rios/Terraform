can be performed on demand or triggered automatically by various events." -Terraform 


1. In terminal use this command to clone a repo by Terraform to launch something small and cool.

git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/tfc-getting-started.git

2. Run these commands in terminal to start up a script to perform your Terraform Cloud run:  

cd tfc-getting-started

./scripts/setup.sh

3. Press any key will it tell you to when setting up the script. It will set up a Terraform cloud which runs Terraform on disposable virtual machines in
its own cloud infrastructure. It sets up the organization, workspace (named 'getting-started) that you can access with the link it gives you. 
It also will create a database, load balancers, servers, and a VPC. This is of no cost to you. 

You now have provisioned infrastructure with Terraform Cloud!
